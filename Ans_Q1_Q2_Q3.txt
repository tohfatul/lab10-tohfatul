Q1. Explain why do we want sometimes to use setImmediate instead of using setTimeout?
    
    Ans. setImmediate callback will almost always be executed before setTimeout(,0). 
    SetImmediate gets executed in the "check" phase. The check phase is called after the I/O phase.
    SetTimeOut gets executed in the "timer" phase. The timer phase is the first phase but is called 
    after the I/O phase as well as the Check phase.

Q2. Explain the difference between process.nextTick and setImmediate?

    Ans. nextTick() is processed after every phase of the event loop and setImmediate() is only processed 
    on the check handler phase of the event loop. process.nextTick() has higher priority over setImmediate().

q3. Does Node.js has window object?

    Ans. Node.js does not have any window object rather the global variable is the global object in Node.js.
